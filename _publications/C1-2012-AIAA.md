abstract: "A work in progress is described that so far includes a finite element (FE) micromechanics modeling
capability that generates random distributions of fibers in a periodic unit cell to predict fatigue damage in the
matrix. The FE micromechanics model has automated features that facilitate parametric studies. This
includes the ability to simulate any three-dimensional macroscopically uniform state of stress and to generate
new fiber distributions within random-periodic unit cells that can have variable numbers of fibers. A damage
evolution variable driven by the kinetic theory of fracture was implemented numerically in the FE
computations. The spatial evolution of damage in the micromechanics model causes the deformation at some
point to become unstable and define macroscopic failure of the composite. The effects of element size, time
increment size, failed element residual properties, and fiber distribution were explored."
