abstract: "The objective of this paper is to introduce and demonstrate a robust methodology for solving multi-constrained 3D topology optimization problems. The proposed methodology is a combination of the topological level-set formulation, augmented Lagrangian algorithm, and assembly-free deflated finite element analysis (FEA). The salient features of the proposed method include: (1) it exploits the topological sensitivity fields that can be derived for a variety of constraints, (2) it rests on well-established augmented Lagrangian formulation to solve constrained problems, and (3) it overcomes the computational challenges by employing assembly-free deflated FEA. The proposed method is illustrated through several 3D numerical experiments."
