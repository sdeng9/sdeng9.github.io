Abstract: The focus of this paper is on topology optimization of continuum structures subject to thermally induced buckling. Popular strategies for solving such problems include Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) and Rational Approximation of Material Properties (RAMP). Both methods rely on material parameterization, and can sometimes exhibit pseudo buckling modes in regions with low pseudo-densities. Here we consider a level-set approach that relies on the concept of topological sensitivity. Topological sensitivity analysis for thermo-elastic buckling is carried out via direct and adjoint formulations. Then, an augmented Lagrangian formulation is presented that exploits these sensitivities to solve a buckling constrained problem. Numerical experiments in 3D illustrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method.
