abstract: "Engineering structures must often be designed to resist thermally induced stresses. Significant progress has been made on the design of such structures through thermo-elastic topology optimization. However, a computationally efficient framework to handle stress-constrained large-scale problems is lacking. The main contribution of this paper is to address this limitation. In particular, a unified topological-sensitivity (TS) based level-set approach is presented in this paper for optimizing thermo-elastic structures subject to non-uniform temperatures. The TS fields for various thermo-elastic objectives are derived, and, to address multiple constraints, an augmented Lagrangian method is developed to explore Pareto topologies. Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework to solve large-scale design problems. Comparison is made between pure elastic problems, and its thermo-elastic counterpart, shedding light on the influence of thermo-elastic coupling on optimized topologies."
