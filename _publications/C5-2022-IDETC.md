Abstract: Predicting the fracture behavior of macroscale components
containing microscopic porosity relies on multiscale damage
models which typically ignore the manufacturing-induced
spatial variabilities in porosity. This simplification is made due
to the prohibitive computational costs associated with explicitly
modeling spatially varying microstructures in a macroscopic
component. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven
framework that integrates a mechanistic reduced-order model
(ROM) with a calibration scheme based on latent map Gaussian
processes (LMGPs). Our ROM drastically accelerates direct
numerical simulations (DNS) by using a stabilized damage
algorithm and systematically reducing the degrees of freedom
via clustering. Since clustering affects local strain fields and
hence the fracture response, we construct a multi-fidelity LMGP
to inversely estimate the damage parameters of an ROM as a
function of microstructure and clustering level such that the
ROM faithfully surrogates DNS. We demonstrate the application
of our framework in predicting the damage behavior of a
multiscale metallic component with spatially varying porosity.
