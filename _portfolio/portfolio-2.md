title: "Research Thrust 2: Machine Learning-Based Mechanics and Design"
excerpt: "While physics-based simulations provide fundamental understanding of material mechanics and facilitate material innovation, they are generally too expensive for multiscale material systems (e.g., composites, alloys and crystals) involving high dimensional design space and complex deformation mechanisms. In this research theme, we develop a data-driven framework that integrates microstructure reconstruction, model reduction, statistical and machine learning models to statistically represent material heterogeneity, relieve data reliance and provide trustworthy prediction.


Our framework is successfully demonstrated in several studies including: (𝑖) data assimilation that relies on Gaussian process to fuse and calibrate reduced-order solutions of different fidelities; (𝑖𝑖) physics-informed deep learning that incorporates thermodynamics into sequential learners to emulate multiscale path-dependent plasticity and fracture propagation; and (𝑖𝑖𝑖) metamaterials design that exploits image-based deep learning to accelerate material geometric optimization with spatially varying unit cells.
