title: "Research Thrust 3: Multiphysics Multi-Constrained Topology Optimization"
excerpt: "Topology optimization (TO) optimizes structural performance by designing material layouts. TO usually involves few design responses but a very large number of design variables characterizing material topology.
Multiphysics TO requires solving coupled multiphysics governing equations with various field variables in optimization loops where the calculation of design sensitivities is considerably expensive. We develop an efficient discrete adjoint sensitivity approach that reduces design space and dispenses with matrix inversion.


TO faces theoretical challenges when solving design problems subject to multiple, various, and conflicting constraints. In this line of research, we combine the topological level-set method (i.e., treating topological sensitivity as a level-set) with the augmented Lagrangian method (i.e., quantifying active and inactive constraints via Lagrangian multipliers) to cast classic gradient-based continuous optimization as a discrete TO with clear 0-1 topological definition.
Our method helps to gain deep insights into high dimensional design space to discover high-value, non-intuitive and manufacturing-feasible designs that would be otherwise difficult, if possible, to obtain through traditional methods.
