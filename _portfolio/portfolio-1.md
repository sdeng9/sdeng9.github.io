title: "Research Thrust 1: Reduce-Order Multiscale Materials Modeling "
excerpt: "Significant advancements have been achieved in microstructural modeling to account for manufacturing-induced material local morphology. However, the practical application of these microscale simulations in real-world design has been limited due to their high computational costs and prohibitive memory footprints.


To overcome this challenge, we develop reduced-order models (ROMs) that approximate computationally intensive simulations with far fewer resources by projecting solution variables into a lower dimension space with spatiotemporal reductions. By integrating ROMs into a concurrent multiscale modeling framework, our reduced-order system efficiently quantifies the impacts of spatially varying microstructures on complex component behaviors, e.g., elasto-plasticity and fracture, which enables low-cost design applications.
