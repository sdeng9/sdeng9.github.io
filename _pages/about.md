Welcome to my page. I am an incoming assistant professor and the director of Design Intelligence Laboratory at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Kansas](https://me.ku.edu/people/shiguang-deng) starting from Fall 2024.

My research vision is to develop data-driven physics-informed design intelligence for advanced material-structure systems by leveraging artificial intelligence and computational mechanics.
I am broadly interested in interdisciplinary topics at the frontiers of design optimization, material design, design for manufacturing, solid mechanics, material informatics, and scientific machine learning.

Experience
======
* From 2023 to 2024, I am a research associate at the Northwestern University advised by Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/chen-wei.html) and Prof. [Horacio Espinosa](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/espinosa-horacio.html) for data-driven design of nonlinear multiscale material systems and advanced manufacturing.
* From 2020 to 2022, I worked with Prof. [Diran Apelian](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/diran-apelian) and Prof. [Ramin Bostanabad](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/ramin-bostanabad) as a postdoctoral fellow  at the University of California Irvine to develop reduced-order models and data-driven surrogates for multiscale metallic alloys with tomography-infused manufacturing-induced porosity distribution.
* From 2016 to 2019, I was a research engineer in the design optimization team of the MSC [NASTRAN](https://hexagon.com/products/product-groups/computer-aided-engineering-software/msc-nastran) to design, develop, test and maintain topology optimization solvers on the generative design platform [APEX](https://hexagon.com/products/msc-apex-generative-design) for additive manufacturing.
* In 2016, I received my Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin Madison.
I was supervised by Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan/) and my research was about augmented topological level-set methods for large-scale thermo-elastic topology optimization.
<!-- * In 2012, I received my M.Sc from the University of Wyoming where I was advised by Prof. [Mark Garnich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cWBG64UAAAAJ&hl=en) on the dynamic progressive damage modeling of strain-rate effects of fiber-reinforced composites. -->
