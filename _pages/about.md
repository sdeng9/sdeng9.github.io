Welcome to my page. I am Shiguang. I am currently an associate researcher (postdoc) at the Northwestern University, working with Prof. [Wei Chen](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/chen-wei.html) and Prof. [Horacio D. Espinosa](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/espinosa-horacio.html) starting from 2023. My overarching research objective is to develop process-aware and information-theoretic design-analysis-manufacturing frameworks for multiscale material-structure systems.

I am broadly interested in interdisciplinary engineering applications at the frontiers of predictive science, scientific machine learning, design optimization and computational mechanics, including **topology optimization**, **reduced-order model**, **data-driven design**, **data assimilation**, and **physics-informed deep learning**.
My research focuses on questions such as:

* How to address computational bottlenecks in large-scale design and analysis?
* How to account for multiple performance and manuf. constraints in design optimization?
* How

Experience
======
* In 2016, I received my Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin Madison.
I was supervised by Prof. [Krishnan Suresh](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/suresh_krishnan/) and my thesis was focus on the augmented topological level-set methods for large-scale thermo-elastic topology optimization.
* From 2016 to 2019, I worked for the design optimization team at the MSC [NASTRAN](https://hexagon.com/products/product-groups/computer-aided-engineering-software/msc-nastran) as a R&D engineer to design, develop, test and maintain the topology optimization engine on the MSC APEX generative design platform.
* From 2019 to 2022, I collaborated with Prof. [Diran Apelian](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/diran-apelian) and Prof. [Ramin Bostanabad](https://engineering.uci.edu/users/ramin-bostanabad) as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California Irvine.
I led the project of data-driven analysis modeling for the multiscale metallic alloys with tomography-infused manufacturing-induced porosity distribution.
