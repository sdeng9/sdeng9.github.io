I was a lecturer/assistant to Professor Wei Chen for the ME 448 course at the Northwestern University.
The course is designed to provide engineering students a view of optimization as a tool for engineering decision making.  Students will be given a fundamental introduction to the optimization techniques and an opportunity to learn how to model design and manufacturing problems and solve them using computer-based numerical optimization techniques. Topics include linear programming, unconstrained nonlinear models, constrained nonlinear optimization, discrete and mixed integer models, shape and topology optimization, design of experiments and machine learning methods, optimization under uncertainty, and multicriteria optimization. Students will be encouraged to relate the course material to their research.
