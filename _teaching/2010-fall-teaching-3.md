I was a graduate teaching assistant to Professor Mark Garnich for this graduate level course ME 5475 (Fall 2010) 
at the University of Wyoming.
This course builds upon the foundational knowledge of FEA and explores advanced topics in modeling development,
mesh selection, nonlinear material constitutive modeling, Newton Raphson methods and convergence study.
Students develop expertise in utilizing FEA to solve complex engineering problems and analyze mechanical systems
through extensive hands-on projects using commercial FEA software ABAQUS.
