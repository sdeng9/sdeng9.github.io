I was a graduate teaching assistant to Professor Krishnan Suresh for this graduate level course ME 748 at the University of Wisconsin Madison.
This course focuses on the principles and methodologies for optimizing the design of mechanical components and systems.
It explores advanced techniques in design optimization, mathematical modeling, and multi-objective
optimization to achieve improved performance, efficiency, and reliability of mechanical systems.
Special topics include size, shape and topology optimization for structure mechanics.
This course enables students to develop a solid understanding of design optimization principles,
mathematical modeling and basic programming tools using MATLAB. -->
