I was a graduate teaching assistant to Professor Dennis Coon for this undergraduate level course ME 3450 (Spring 2010) 
at the Mechanical Engineering Department of University of Wyoming.
The course introduces the fundamental principles and techniques involved in the manufacturing of composite materials. 
It provides a comprehensive overview of the processes and technologies used in the production of composite components, 
with an emphasis on practical applications and hands-on experience.
By a combination of lectures, laboratory sessions, and projects, students should be able to develop a solid understanding of 
composite material manufacturing processes, including material selection, lay-up techniques, curing methods, and quality control.
