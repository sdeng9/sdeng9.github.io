I was a graduate teaching assistant to Professor Sukky Jun for this graduate level course ME 5000 (Fall 2009) 
at the University of Wyoming.
The course topics include stress and strain analysis, mechanical properties of materials, energy methods, and a brief
introduction to elasticity and plasticity.
This course serves as a foundation for advanced topics in structural analysis, mechanics of materials, and mechanical design.
